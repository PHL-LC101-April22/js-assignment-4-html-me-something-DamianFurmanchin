<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone. I'm Damian. I'm originally from the Poconos in Northeast Pennsylvania, but I have been living and working in Philadelphia as a public school teacher for the last 15 years. I love music, traveling, traveling to see music, trying new food, drinking coffee, riding my bike, reading science-fiction novels, and spending time with my wife and parrots. I hate pretty much everything else. For this project I chose to focus on my travels because they have been on my mind a lot lately while doing research for a vacation to Greece in late July.</p>
      <h2> Where I Have Traveled</h2>
      <p><em>Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God. - Kurt Vonnegut (Cat's Cradle)</em><br></p>
      <p>Below is a list of the major places that I have traveled. I have traveled quite a bit throughout  much of the US, but felt that sharing the (mostly) international trips would be more exciting.

   <h2>1. San Francisco (2009)</h2>
<p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This trip set the stage for one of the things I feel very passionately about, traveling. 
   Growing up poor in the Coal Region of Northeast Pennsylvania, I did not have the opportunity to travel anywhere other 
   than East Coast shore towns. So when I finally graduated college and started my career I suddenly had more money than I knew what to 
   do with (At least until my 6 month grace period for student loans was over). At first I was reckless, so I glued a bunch of $1 
   bills together to make a two-piece suit and went to the strip club with my friend Sleepy Ray Ray. I bought one of 
   those money shooting guns to make it rain which was great at first, but I probably should have picked somewhere 
   other than the I-95 overpass to test this new gadget out. Although I had a lot of fun doing those things, I knew that there must be 
something other than cheap thrills that I could spend my money on. So when my girlfriend Elizabeth, who is now my wife, picked me up from 
the 3rd Police Precint we decided that we needed to get out of the city and a trip to the West Coast was discussed and booked that same night. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I lost most of the photos from this trip after a hard drive crash and only found the photo of Alcatraz pictured below.  
   If I did have more photos, you would be dazzled with poorly taken shots of Fisherman's Wharf, Telegraph Hill, Angel Island, Alcatraz, 
   concert photos from 2 Phish shows at the Greek Theater in Berkley, Golden Gate Park, and so on. My wife and I had so much fun on this
trip that we had decided to travel every summer and try to travel internationally every few years. When we got home we started 
saving for our first international trip. </p>

   <h2>2. Europe: Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, And Belgium (2011)</h2>
   <p>After saving for two years we decided to go big on our next vacation. We spent a total 24 days spread out across four countries. The countries listed above
      are the order that we visited each location. Coincidentally, this is also how I would rank each country on the trip. France and the Netherlands
      are tied for second place as they both had so much to offer and differered in culture, cuisine, and atmosphere in the best way possible.
   The highlight of the trip for me was when we hiked up the River Aare in Bern, Switzerland (pictured in the background of the first photo) and hopped into the cool, clear Alpine water and 
floated all the way back to the center of the city.</p>

   <h2>3. Spain: The Mediterranean Coast (2013) </h2>
   <p>After my previous trip, I felt like other locations couldn't live up to the incredible experience that I had in 2011.
      Spain did not disappoint. Our trip started in Barcelona where we spent four nights before continuing down the Mediterranean Coast. We were fortunate
      enought to be able to attend the Gracia Festival where an absolutely massive neighborhood decorates block-by-block with a specific theme. From Barcelona we traveled
      down the Mediterranean Coast via train to the small, but historic, city of Tarragona. Aside from being a relaxed coastal destination, Tarragona is home to 
   Roman ruins dating back to the 2nd century. After a few days checking out this medieval city we hopped back on the train and continued further 
southeast down the coast to Valencia. We stayed in the historic Old Centre of the city which made it extremely easy to get around and explore
everything Valencia had to offer. The highlight of this trip was probably our bike ride through a drained riverbed that spans a large section of the city.
After our stay in Valencia we headed to the airport to catch a flight to Ibiza. While in Ibiza we enjoyed the beaches and the incredible electronic
music scence that the destination is well known for. After a quick two days in Ibiza we took the 40 minute flight back to Valencia and boarded
a train to our last destination, the coastal city fo Alicante. Alicante was the most low-key destination and we planned this as our last stop
so we could relax and enjoy the pristine beaches and narrow, winding, and vibrant scenery. After our stay here we took the train to Madrid 
so that we could catch our flight home.</p>

   <h2>4. Thailand (2015)</h2>
   <p>In 2015 we traveled to Thailand for our honeymoon. Our trip started in Bangkok where we got to experience Thai city life before
      flying to the island of Phuket, and on to our final destination before heading home, an ancient city hidden in the mountains, Chiang Mai. We really
      packed a lot into this trip and it would take entirely too long to dive deeply into it. The highlight for me was taking the ferry from Phuket to 
      another island named Koh Phi Phi, the filming location of the Leonardo Dicaprio film The Beach. After an all night party on the beach my wife
      and I hiked up to the peak of the tallest mountain to enjoy the sunrise before finally getting some sleep.

   <h2>5. Costa Rica (2018)</h2>
   <p>Our trip to Costa Rica was a last minute decision, but a great experience. Upon arrival, we rented a car and immediately started exploring
      the country. We started in San Jose and drove to La Fortuna. This town is best known for being the site of the Arenal Volcano. After doing 
      some hiking around the volcano we drove around Lake Arenal to Monteverde, home to one of the largest cloud forests and the Continental Divide. 
      Our next destination was a ferry which would take us across the Gulf of Nicoya where we would eventually make our way to a sleepy coastal named
      Montezuma. Montezuma has miles of empty beaches flanked by large sections of rainforest where we got to experience the wildlife
      up close and personal. At one point I had to fight off a troupe of capuchin monkeys with a piece of driftwood because they had descended
      from the canopy and started raiding my backpack. I was afraid that they would run off with the keys to our rental car and leave us stranded
      far from where we needed to be with no way to get keys or the vahicle started, so I took action. I can't imagine what this must have looked like to
      my wife, but chasing a troupe of 25+ monkeys into the rainforest made me feel pretty damn heroic.

   <h2>6. Greece (2022?)</h2>
   <p>Now that the world is opening back up and travel restrictions have been lifted, my wife and I plan to travel to Greece this summer.
      We have very little planned other than the flights, so as we do more research will will firm up exactly where we will go. Below is a 
   picture of what I envision I would like to do while there. </p>
